# D-Social
The main objective of a blockchain-based social media platform is to 
create a decentralized system where users have complete control over their 
data and content. This platform should aim to provide greater transparency 
and security, ensuring that user data is stored across a distributed network 
of nodes. By using blockchain technology, the platform can eliminate the 
risk of centralized control or censorship. Users will be able to create and 
share content on this platform with confidence that their data is secure and 
not subject to manipulation or unauthorized access.
